# Goal:

Here we aim to download all available DNA binding protein (DBP) profiles in a single cell state (measured by ChIP-seq). This will allow us to investigate the binding properties of hundreds of DBPs in the same cellular context or background. We aim to address several questions: 

(i) What are the number of peaks and genome coverage for each DBP? 

(ii) What are the binding preferences for promoters, gene-bodies and intergenic genomic regions? 

(iii) What are the similarities and differences across DBPs based on their genome-wide binding profiles genome-wide? 

(iv) What properties or preferences do promoters have for binding events. 

(v) How does binding to a promoter affect the transcriptional output of that promoter?

(vi) Are there reservoir promoters in HepG2 as defined in k562 previously? 



To address these questions we have curated a set of over 1,000 ChIPseq data sets comprised of 48 DBPs in HEPG2 cells from the ENCODE consortium. We required duplicate ChIP-seq experiments for a given DBP and other criterion that can be found here :

<https://www.encodeproject.org/report/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended>

## These samples were selected on the following criteria:

1)  "chromatin" interaction data, then DNA binding data, cell line HEPG2, "TF-Chip-seq".
2)  We further selected "TF Chip-seq", "Control chip-seq" and "Histone Chip-seq".
3)  We selected several read lengths to get the most DNA binding proteins (DBPs)
4)  Read lengths: 100, 76, 75, 36
5)  ONLY SINGLE END READS (this eliminates 54 samples)

### Experimental data was downloading by (ENCODE report.tsv):

<https://www.encodeproject.org/report.tsv?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended>

### The FASTQ files were downloaded with:

"<https://www.encodeproject.org/metadata/?status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended&type=Experiment>"

MD5sums were checked with all passing (see encode_file_info function to reterive MD5Sum values that are not available from the encode portal (/util)

### Processing data:

We processed all the read alignments and peak calling using the NF_CORE ChIP-seq pipeline: (nfcore/chipseq v1.2.2)

## Next we created consensus peaks that overlap in both replicates

Our strategy was to take peaks in each replicate and find all overlapping peak windows. We then took the union length of the overlapping range in each peak window. We further required that a DBP has at least 1,000 peaks (the min quartile of peaks observed)

Result: 
(i) we have 430 DBPs that have at least 1,000 peaks in both replicates

## We will start with loading filtered consensus peaks (described above)
## All subequent analyses are contained within this document.
## To find results, search for "Result:"

# Loading in all .broadPeak files for all dbps and their replicates
```{r load .broadPeak files}

broadpeakfilepath <- "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/data/data/peaks"

# importing peaks as granges with "import_peaks" function
# can take 10+ min !
peak_list <- import_peaks(consensus_file_path = broadpeakfilepath)

```

# creating consensus peaks
Using consensus_from_reduced function that requires peak list
and dbp object. This will be done in 2 steps
(1) created dbp object of unique names for dbp
(2) run consensus_from_reduced

```{r create consensus peaks}

  # Creating unique DBP object for create_consensus_peaks_from_reduced
dbp <- unique(sapply(names(peak_list), function(x) {
   unlist(strsplit(x, "_"))[1]
}))

# now run our function consensus_from_reduced
consensus_list <- lapply(dbp, consensus_from_reduced, peak_list)

# adding names to the GRange list
names(consensus_list) <- dbp

```

# exploring number of peaks per DBP for filtering
```{r exploring number of peaks in consenus peaks}

# creating list of num_peaks per dbp
num_peaks <- sapply(consensus_list, length)

# plotting

hist(num_peaks, breaks = 1000, xlim = c(0,3000))
ggsave("figures/hist_num_peaks.pdf")

```
Result:
(i)seems like 1000 peaks should be the min moving forward.

Result: 
(i) Most DBPs show similar binding profiles between lncRNA/mRNA promoters
(ii) a few interesting ones EZH2 is more bound over TSS of lncRNA promoters
(iii) H2AFZ is the most depleted over TSS
(iv) H3K4me2 is more enriched over lncRNA TSS
(v) H3K4me1 is slightly more over lncRNA promoters
(vi) ZNF460 has different pattern between mRNA and lncRNA promoters


# DBP Binding versus RNA expression output
Now we are going to explore how binding to a promoter relates to gene
expression output. We will use RNAseq data from ENCODE in HEPG2.
The data is RNA from differnet fractions -- it was run throguh 
NF_CORE RNAseq pipeline v1.4.2

The data files are here:

```{bash RNAseq files}

# ENCODE report on experimental accessions used (fractionated and total RNA HEPG2)

# wget -O samples.txt "https://www.encodeproject.org/report.tsv?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=Transcription&assay_slims=Transcription&replicates.library.biosample.donor.organism.scientific_name=Homo+sapiens&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&assay_title=total+RNA-seq&files.read_length=50&limit=all&advancedQuery=date_released:[2009-01-01%20TO%202021-12-31]"

# This will give us a text file of the file names.  

# wget -O files.txt "https://www.encodeproject.org/batch_download/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=Transcription&assay_slims=Transcription&replicates.library.biosample.donor.organism.scientific_name=Homo+sapiens&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&assay_title=total+RNA-seq&files.read_length=50&limit=all&advancedQuery=date_released:[2009-01-01%20TO%202021-12-31]"


```


First we want to load in our final_samplesheet from 01_DESEQ_counts.Rmd
# Reading in sample sheet

```{r read in sample_sheet}
# First let's read in the sample sheet to know what is what
samplesheet <- read_rds("../../../05_R_analyses/05_RNAseq/01_differential_expression/results/final_samplesheet.rds")
```

# reading in TPM values from Salmon for our analyses

```{r reading in salmon Salmon TPMs}

# reading in salmon tpm
salmon_tpm <- read.csv("../../../05_R_analyses/05_RNAseq/00_RNAseq_download_NF_core_pipeline/00_NF_CORE_RNAseq_Pipeline_run/results/salmon/salmon_merged_gene_tpm.csv")

# TPM table is in same order as samplesheet
tpm <- salmon_tpm %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:ncol(.), names_to = "sample_id", values_to = "tpm") %>%
  merge(samplesheet) %>%
  group_by(gene_id, condition) %>%
  summarize(tpm = mean(tpm, na.rm = T)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = condition, values_from = tpm, names_prefix = "tpm_")
```

# determining how many DBPs are bound at each promoter

```{r loading in peak features data frame }

# peak_occurrence_df is loaded in our environment and contains how many DBPs bind to each promoter (rows)
promoter_features_df <- merge(peak_occurrence_df, tpm)

# DBP density plot
ggplot(promoter_features_df, aes(x = number_of_dbp)) +
  geom_density() 

# saving
  ggsave("figures/DBP_binding_density_plot.pdf")

```
result: There appears to be a bimodal distribution of binding at promoters.
those with less than 100dbps and those with more than 250


# Abundance of genes in each cellular fraction

```{r TPM of genes in each fraction}
# First we need to the tpm DF into a matrix


tpm_matrix <- tpm %>% 
  column_to_rownames("gene_id") %>%
  as.matrix()
tpm_scaled <- t(scale(t(tpm_matrix)))
tpm_scaled <- tpm_scaled[complete.cases(tpm_scaled),]


# plotting
new.env()
pdf("figures/heatmap_expression.pdf", height =49, width = 12)
pheatmap::pheatmap(tpm_scaled, show_rownames = FALSE)
graphics.off()

```
RESULT: 
(1) Most RNAs are abundant in the nucleus
(2) Some RNAs expressed in total that are not in other fractions


# Plotting binding versus expression

Now let's examine how binding effects expression.
We have published previously that the more binding
events at a promoter the more abundant the expression is.
Let's see if this holds for our current subset of DBPs
```{r DBP promoter binding versus total RNA expression}

# plotting binding vs total RNA expression
ggplot(promoter_features_df, 
            aes(y = log2(tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2 + 0.001), x = number_of_dbp, color = gene_type)) + 
geom_point(data = promoter_features_df %>% filter(tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2 > 0.001),
             shape = 17, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")) +
  stat_cor() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#a8404c", "#424242"), name = "Gene type") + 
  ggtitle("Expression vs. promoter binding events") + 
  xlab(expression('Number of TFs')) +
  ylab(expression(log[2](TPM))) 

ggsave("figures/binding_vs_expression_total_rna.pdf")
```
Result: 
(1) There is a linear trend with number of DBPS and expression levels
(2) There is a population of genes that have numerous DBPs with low expression


# Binding versus nuclear expression
Let's see if the binding versus expression holds in the nuclear fraction
```{r binding versus nuclear expression}

# Now let's make a similar plot for nuclear RNA abundance versus #DBPs bound to their promoter
ggplot(promoter_features_df, 
            aes(y = log2(tpm_homo_sapiens_nuclear_fraction + 0.001), x = number_of_dbp, color = gene_type)) + 
  geom_point(data = promoter_features_df %>% filter(tpm_homo_sapiens_nuclear_fraction > 0.001),
             shape = 17, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")) +
  stat_cor() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#a8404c", "#424242"), name = "Gene type") + 
  ggtitle("Nuclear Expression vs. promoter binding events") + 
  xlab(expression('Number of TFs')) +
  ylab(expression(log[2](TPM))) 
  # saving figure
  ggsave("figures/nuclear_expression-vs-promoter_binding.pdf")
```
RESULT: 
(i) looks very similar to total RNA binding versus expression


# Binding versus cytoplasmic expression

Next we will determine the DBP binding versus cytoplasmic expression
```{Binding versus cytoplasmic expression}

# Same thing just seeing if there is a difference of cyto RNAs versus DBPs on promoter
ggplot(promoter_features_df, 
            aes(y = log2(tpm_homo_sapiens_cytosolic_fraction + 0.001), x = number_of_dbp, color = gene_type)) + 
  geom_point(data = promoter_features_df %>% filter(tpm_homo_sapiens_cytosolic_fraction > 0.001),
             shape = 17, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")) +
  stat_cor() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#a8404c", "#424242"), name = "Gene type") + 
  ggtitle("Cytoplasmic Expression vs. promoter binding events") + 
  xlab(expression('Number of TFs')) +
  ylab(expression(log[2](TPM))) 
  # saving figure
  ggsave("figures/cytoplasmic_expression-vs-promoter_binding.pdf")
  
```
Result:
(1) everything seems to be low abundance 
(2) Some mRNAs are expressed in the nucleus -- we could look at this more later.
(3) The same linear trend holds but is driven by mostly low expression events.

# lncRNA versus mRNA expression in total RNA
Next we will directly test the lncRNA vs mRNA expression levels in total RNA. 

```{r determining lncRNA and mRNA expression levels in total RNA}

# plotting
ggplot(promoter_features_df, aes(x = log2(tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2 + 0.01), color = gene_type))+
  geom_density()

# saving figure
ggsave("figures/mrna_lncrna_tpm_total_rna.pdf")

# let's also do the same for nuclear since lncRNAs are typically more nuclear
ggplot(promoter_features_df, aes(x = log2(tpm_homo_sapiens_nuclear_fraction + 0.01), color = gene_type))+
  geom_density()

# saving figure
ggsave("figures/mrna_lncrna_tpm_nuclear.pdf")
```
Result:
(i) This yet again confirms lncRNAs have lower expression levels than mRNAs.
(ii) In the nuclear fraction it shift's to closer.
(ii) lot's of mRNA with nuclear expression -- that seems odd



We have previously observed that k562 cells also exhibit high binding promoters
that are not expressed. We termed them 'reservoirs' as they are a reservoir
for many Dna-protein interaction sites. Based on the plot above we observed that
this phenomena also exists in hepG2 cells as well. 

Based on this we next wanted to identify the 'reservoirs' in hepG2 cells.
```{r defining HEPG2 reservoirs}


# first we will use a cutoff of 100 DBPs.
promoter_features_df$hepg2_reservoir <- 
  as.numeric(promoter_features_df$number_of_dbp > 5 & 
               promoter_features_df$tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2 < 0.001)

# seeing what we got with table
table(promoter_features_df$hepg2_reservoir)

```
Result:
(i) There are 2,360 reservoirs in this largert data set in HEPG2


Now that we have defined reservoirs in hepG2 cells, we next want to determine how many 
are similar genomic regions in k562 and hepG2.

```{r reading in K562 reservoirs}

# reading in k562 promoter_features_DF
k562_df <- read_csv("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/CLASS_2023/data/data/2020_k562_promoter_peak_df.csv")

# next we want to merge the k562 adn Hepg2 DFs 
k562_df <- k562_df %>% 
  dplyr::select(gene_id, reservoir, conservative_reservoir, tpm, expression, tf_binding, promoter_mean_tpm, promoter_median_tpm, promoter_max_tpm) %>%
  dplyr::rename(k562_reservoir = reservoir, 
                k562_conservative_reservoir = conservative_reservoir,
                k562_expression = expression,
                k562_tpm = tpm,
                k562_tf_binding = tf_binding,
                k562_promoter_mean_tpm =  promoter_mean_tpm,
                k562_promoter_median_tpm = promoter_median_tpm,
                k562_promoter_median_tpm = promoter_median_tpm,
                k562_promoter_max_tpm = promoter_max_tpm)

# save this file in new format
write_csv(k562_df,"results/k562_df.csv")

# renaming promoter_features_df to hepg2_df
hepg2_df <- promoter_features_df %>%
  dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_name, tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2, tpm_homo_sapiens_cytosolic_fraction, tpm_homo_sapiens_nuclear_fraction, tpm_homo_sapiens_insoluble_cytoplasmic_fraction, tpm_homo_sapiens_membrane_fraction, number_of_dbp, hepg2_reservoir) %>%
   dplyr::rename( tpm_total = tpm_homo_sapiens_hepg2,
                 tpm_cytosolic_fraction =  tpm_homo_sapiens_cytosolic_fraction,
                 tpm_nuclear_fraction = tpm_homo_sapiens_nuclear_fraction ,
                 tpm_insoluble_cytoplasmic_fraction = tpm_homo_sapiens_insoluble_cytoplasmic_fraction ,
                 tpm_membrane_fraction = tpm_homo_sapiens_membrane_fraction)

# let's save this handy file
write_csv(hepg2_df,"results/hepg2_df.csv")
  
# Let's merge the k562 reservoirs in with HEPG2_df
# Merges on Gene_id
hepg2_k562_promoter_features_df <- merge(hepg2_df, k562_df)

# Now saving
write_csv(hepg2_k562_promoter_features_df, "results/hepg2_k562_promoter_features_df.csv")

# Make a table of reservoir status
res_status <- hepg2_k562_promoter_features_df %>% 
  group_by(hepg2_reservoir, k562_reservoir, k562_conservative_reservoir) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

# saving for future
write_csv2(res_status, "results/reservoir_overlap_stats.csv")
```
Result:
(i) There are 345 reservoirs in both K562 and HEPG2
(ii) There are 80 Hepg2 reservoirs that overlap "conservative" k562 reservoirs
