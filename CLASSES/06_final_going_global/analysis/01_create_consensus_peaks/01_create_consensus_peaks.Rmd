# Loading in all .broadPeak files for all dbps and their replicates

```{r load .broadPeak files}

# using import peaks to import .broadPeak files (~10min)
peak_list <- import_peaks(consensus_file_path = broadpeakfilepath)

```

# creating consensus peaks
Using consensus_from_reduced function that requires peak list
and dbp object. This will be done in 2 steps
(1) created dbp object of unique names for dbp
(2) run consensus_from_reduced


```{r create consensus peaks}

  # Creating unique DBP object for create_consensus_peaks_from_reduced
dbp <- unique(sapply(names(peak_list), function(x) {
   unlist(strsplit(x, "_"))[1]
})) # remove replicate number

# now run our function consensus_from_reduced
consensus_list <- lapply(dbp, consensus_from_reduced, peak_list)

# adding names to the GRange list
names(consensus_list) <- dbp

save(consensus_list, file = "results/consensus_list.RData")

load("results/consensus_list.RData", verbose = T)
```
There are 486 proteins.

# exploring the number of peaks in the consensus_list
```{r exploring number of peaks in consenus peaks}

# creating list of num_peaks per dbp
num_peaks <- sapply(consensus_list, length) # vector of number of peaks for each protein

# plotting
hist(num_peaks, breaks = 1000)
hist(num_peaks, breaks = 1000, xlim = c(0,3000))

```
Result: seems like 1000 peaks should be the min moving forward.

# filtering consensus_list to dbps with > 1000 peaks
```{r filtered_consenus_list}

# filtering to 1000 peaks
filtered_consensus_list <- consensus_list[sapply(consensus_list, length) > 1000]

# saving 
save(filtered_consensus_list, file = "results/filtered_consensus_list.RData")

# keeping track of DBPs lost
lost_dbps <- names(consensus_list[sapply(consensus_list, length) < 1000]) %>% as.data.frame()

# same as
# lost_dbp <- names(consensus_peaks)[!(names(consensus_peaks) %in% names(filtered_consensus_peaks))]

# saving 
write.table(lost_dbps, "results/lost_dbps.csv")

Filtered now only has 430 files.
