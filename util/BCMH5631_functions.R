#' CREATE CONSENSUS PEAKS
#' this function will take multiple replicate .broadPeak files (also narrow)
#' find peaks that overlap in all the replicates. 
#' @description 
#' input set of chipseq replicate peak files
#' this function then creates one merged file peaks in all samples
#' @param dbp
#' This will be extracted with names(GR_list) in the lapply at end of fun
#' You will need a "dbps" or some object for the lapply that has the 
#' name of each dbp in the named GRanges list
#' 
#' @param peak_list
#' Named list of GRanges for each chipseq replicate
#' peak_list can be generated using import_peaks function above
